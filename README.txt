How to use (works best on 1920x1080 100% scale and Roblox full screen):
- !EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE!
- !HAVE AUTOHOTKEY INSTALLED! https://www.autohotkey.com/ (v1.1 deprecated)
- Go to Stella.
- Open the crafting menu.
- Select the potion you want to craft IN GAME (make sure to auto add as well).
- Open the macro and select the potion to auto craft.
- If you want to Glitch hunt and use this macro at the same time, it's recommended to pair with https://github.com/maxstellar/maxstellar-Biome-Macro

Keep note that not all screens are the same, so sometimes even with a different resolution or even same resolution try adjusting the scale a little bit (for example: 100% -> 150%)
