How to use (works best on 1920x1080 150% scale and Roblox non full screen):
- !EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE!
- !HAVE AUTOHOTKEY INSTALLED! https://www.autohotkey.com/
- Run the macro as administrator if you have issues with the start and stop button.
- Go to Stella.
- Open the crafting menu.
- Select the potion you want to craft IN GAME (make sure to auto add as well).
- Open the macro and select the potion to auto craft.

Keep note that not all screens are the same, so sometimes even with a different resolution or even same resolution try adjusting the scale a little bit (for example: 100% -> 150%)
