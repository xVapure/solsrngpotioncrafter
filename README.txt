How to use (works best on 1920x1080 100% scale and Roblox full screen):
- !EXTRACT THE ZIP FILE!
- Go to Stella.
- Open the crafting menu.
- Select the potion you want to craft IN GAME (make sure to auto add as well).
- Open the macro and select the potion to auto craft.
- If you want to hunt for Glitched/Dreamspace biomes and use this macro at the same time, it's recommended to pair with https://github.com/cresqnt-sys/MultiScope or https://github.com/xVapure/Noteab-Macro/
- You can now record your own potion paths!
- If it was detected as virus, it's false positives. Refer to these two tutorials on how to fix: https://youtu.be/zGiNGnX5dYg?si=uC-qDKqVoC68txy8 https://youtu.be/_0_A9D0JeVo?si=ahXKpVYbs-HhOwSC

Keep note that not all screens are the same, so if it doesn't fit your screen use the Potion Recorder feature.
